# Smoke and Fire Classification using Transfer Learning

This project focuses on classifying images into two categories: **Smoke** and **Fire**, using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. We use EfficientNetB0 as a pre-trained model, perform fine-tuning, and visualize performance through evaluation metrics and graphs.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- **Problem**: Binary classification of images into "Smoke" or "Fire"
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset organized into train/test folders
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Image resizing to 224x224
  - Normalization
  - Label encoding
- **Visualization**:
  - Class distribution
  - Sample images

## ðŸ“¦ Techniques Used

- Transfer Learning with **EfficientNetB0**
- Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning
- Partial Layer Freezing
- Data Augmentation (optional)
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- Deployment Phase: Prediction on unseen images
